 **<u>Story about dataset**</u>

1. After centuries of intense whaling, recovering whale populations still have a hard time adapting to warming oceans and struggle to compete every day with the industrial fishing industry for food.

2. To aid whale conservation efforts, scientists use photo surveillance systems to monitor ocean activity. They use the shape of whalesâ€™ tails and unique markings found in footage to identify what species of whale theyâ€™re analyzing and meticulously log whale pod dynamics and movements. For the past 40 years, most of this work has been done manually by individual scientists, leaving a huge trove of data untapped and underutilized.

3. We'd like to thank Happywhale for providing this data and problem. [Happywhale](https://happywhale.com/) is a platform that uses image process algorithms to let anyone to submit their whale photo and have it automatically identified.
